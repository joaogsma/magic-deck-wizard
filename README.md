# MTG Deck Wizard
MTG Deck Wizard is a simple command line tool for extracting metrics from magic the gathering deck lists.

## Quick Start (TLDR version)
```
# In both cases, the installation directory is build/install/mtg-deck-wizard

# Unix
$ ./gradlew installShadowDist
$ build/install/mtg-deck-wizard-shadow/bin/mtg-deck-wizard <filename>

# Windows
$ ./gradlew.bat installShadowDist
$ build/install/mtg-deck-wizard-shadow/bin/mtg-deck-wizard.bat <filename>
```

## Decklists
Deck lists are specified in `.deck` files containing one card specification per line. The 
application requires the following information of each card:
- Number of copies in the deck
- Name 
- Mana cost
- Colors
- Card types
- CMC
- Tags (optional)

To create a deck list, a user can either specify all those for each card, or alternatively only the 
number of copies, name and tags (if any). In the latter case, the application will fetch the missing 
information from Scryfall.

### Syntax
The two variant syntaxes are detailed below. Comments and whitespaces are ignored when reading a 
deck list.
```
[<number of copies>] <card name> @<tag 1> @<tag 2> @<tag 3>
[<number of copies>] <card name> {manacost: "<mana cost>", colors: "<colors>", types: [<list of types>], cmc: <cmc>} @<tag>
```

The mana cost can be a combination of:
- `{X}`: Mana cost of X
- `{n}`: Fixed generic mana cost. N can be any positive integer, such as `{1}` and `{2}`
- `{W}`: Single white mana
- `{U}`: Single blue mana
- `{B}`: Single black mana
- `{R}`: Single red mana
- `{G}`: Single white mana
- `{W}`: Single white mana
- `{<color 1>/<color 2>}`: Hybrid mana
- `{<color>/P}`: Phyrexian mana

The colors are a combination of `W`, `U`, `B`, `R`, `G`.

The types are a list of elements from among `Creature`, `Instant`, `Sorcery`, `Artifact`, 
`Enchantment`, `Planeswalker` and `Land`. 

#### Examples
Some examples are detailed below. For entire example deck lists, check the `examples` folder.
```
// This is a comment

// Colorless card
[1] Horn of Greed @draw @symmetrical
// Same card with full syntax
[1] Horn of Greed {manacost: "{3}", colors: "", types: [Artifact], cmc: 3.00} @draw @symmetrical

// Non-colorless card
[1] Khalni Heart Expedition @ramp @land_to_battlefield
// Same wcard with full syntax
[1] Khalni Heart Expedition {manacost: "{1}{G}", colors: "G", types: [Enchantment], cmc: 2.00} @ramp @land_to_battlefield
```

## Installation
### Distribution
To install the application, run:
```
# Unix
$ ./gradlew installShadowDist

# Windows
$ ./gradlew.bat installShadowDist
```
This should install a distribution on the `build/install/mtg-deck-wizard-shadow` directory. To run 
the installed distribution, first go to its directory, and then run:
```
# Unix
$ bin/mtg-deck-wizard <filename>

# Windows
$ bin/mtg-deck-wizard.bat <filename>
```
where `<filename>` is a path for a deck list, such as `../../../examples/tatyova.txt`

### Runnable JAR (Alternative Installation)
To build a runnable jar file, run:
```
# Unix
$ ./gradlew shadowJar

# Windows
$ ./gradlew.bat shadowJar
```

Alternatively, since the `lib/mtg-deck-wizard-<version>.jar` file is a runnable jar, you can also
run the application with the command:
```
$ java -jar lib/mtg-deck-wizard-<version>.jar <filename>
```

## Releasing a new version
To release a new version, run:
```
# Unix
$ ./gradlew release -Prelease.scope=<scope> -Prelease.stage=<stage>

# Windows
$ ./gradlew.bat release -Prelease.scope=<scope> -Prelease.stage=<stage>
```
where `<scope>` can be `patch`, `minor` or `major`, and `<stage>` can be `dev`, `milestone` or 
`final`.
